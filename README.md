# A simple way to make transponder file to Gpredict

I got tired of writing together transponders in notepad++ files and automating parts of it, so I created this program.

## How it works
Quite simple, you enter the data you have access to and then you press save .trsp file, and voila, you have a ready transponder file!
As for the moment, I have only tested it on my Windows 11 computer, I will try to make an HTML file to be able to get around OS support.
It is written in Python and run with PyInstaller to create an .EXE file, but I have put the Python program in the scr folder in case you have a different operating system and want to test it.
If you have several different transponders on the same satellite, you can add blocks for each transponder.
